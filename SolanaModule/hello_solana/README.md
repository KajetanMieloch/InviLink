# InviLink

## Project Description

**InviLink** is a web3.0 platform for selling and managing event tickets using blockchain technology. This engineering project aims to create a web3.0 platform that facilitates the sale and trade of tickets for concerts and various events, leveraging blockchain technology. This approach ensures that users have full control over their tickets, making transactions more transparent and secure. The target audience includes event organizers—especially smaller companies and private individuals—who prioritize user privacy, as well as participants who value the security and convenience of managing tickets online.

The application's functionality includes the ability to purchase, sell, and exchange tickets among users. Buyers, by becoming owners of tickets in the form of NFT tokens, gain full rights to manage and trade their tickets. Each event organizer can precisely determine the number of available tickets, set their prices, and plan subsequent ticket batches—all within a transparent and secure blockchain-based environment.

This application allows anyone to become an event organizer, providing a simple and intuitive platform for ticket sales while eliminating risks associated with counterfeit tickets and illegal intermediaries. Moreover, blockchain ensures the transparency of each transaction and easy access to the ticket's history, further increasing user trust.

From a technical perspective, the web application will be built using Django as the backend framework, ensuring the project's stability and scalability. The user interface will be designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with Bootstrap simplifying the creation of a responsive design, providing a user-friendly experience. Additionally, the implementation of blockchain will utilize the Solana network and the Phantom wallet, enabling the deployment and management of NFTs as tickets.

In writing this project and preparing my engineering thesis, I will apply the languages and technologies I have learned during my studies, allowing me to combine theoretical knowledge with practical experience.
